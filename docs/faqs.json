Magic is hard to find these days. Have you ever tried looking for it?</p>\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\">Known Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Menus: The Caf&#39;s menu is borked. BonApp added a new icon that we weren&#39;t expecting, and we don&#39;t handle that very gracefully. We&#39;re releasing an update shortly that both handles the new icon and shouldn&#39;t crash when this happens in the future.</li>\n<li>SIS: we&#39;re working on a way to have you log into the sis for more than 15 minutes at a time.</li>\n<li>Building Hours: It reports the 2am buildings as open too often; for instance, the Pause is open on Saturday at 2am, continuing from Friday, but the app reports it as being open on Friday at 2am, as well. This is incorrect.</li>\n<li>The Cage menu only shows specials: that&#39;s a limitation of the data we get from BonApp. SGA is talking with them about providing the rest of the Cage menu. One day, it&#39;ll suddenly work!</li>\n</ul>\n"

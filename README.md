## Note
The Calendar might nag you for a Google Calendar API key. You can either ask someone involved with this project for a key, or you may [create one yourself](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials) for use during development.

1. Create a copy of the `.env.sample.js` file and rename it to `.env.js`
2. Insert your API key in place of the `key goes here` text

## Contributing
Would you like to contribute? Great! Have a look at [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and make a pull request! PRs are required, so fork away and make one! If you feel like you should have write access to the repo, please make an issue and we can discuss it.

If you are looking to get a start with the project, issues tagged [`good first change`](https://github.com/StoDevX/AAO-React-Native/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+change%22) are a great place to start. These issues are ones that the team has identified as simple, small changes that won't get too deep, and will be easy to approve for merging.

We use two continuous-integration (CI) systems to make sure that the project still works as we change things. Any submissions you make will be validated by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/StoDevX/AAO-React-Native/builds) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hawkrives/aao-react-native/history), the CIs.

As always, please keep the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/StoDevX/AAO-React-Native/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md) in mind.

Before you commit and push, make sure to lint your changes and fix any errors or warnings that `npm run lint` shows. We try to keep the `master` branch clean of all messages from eslint.

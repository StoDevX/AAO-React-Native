## About
The St. Olaf community, now in pocket size... rewritten in React Native.  This is a rewrite of [All About Olaf](http://drewvolz.com/all-about-olaf/) in React Native as it is currently written in Objective-C.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- `cd` into the folder
- Install React Native: http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content
- `npm install`
- `npm run ios`

## Note
The Calendar might nag you for a Google Calendar API key. You can either ask someone involved with this project for a key, or you may [create one yourself](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials) for use during development.

1. Create a copy of the `.env.sample.js` file and reanme it to `.env.js`
2. Insert your API key in place of the `key goes here` text

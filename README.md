## Note
The Calendar won't work until you give it a Google Calendar API key. You should  [create one yourself](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials)!

1. Create a copy of the `.env.sample.js` file and rename it to `.env.js`
2. Insert your API key in place of the `key goes here` text

### Notes

- The Calendar won't work until you give it a proper Google Calendar API key.
You should [create one yourself](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials)!
  1. Create a copy of the `.env.sample.js` file and rename it to `.env.js`.
  2. Insert your API key in place of the `key goes here` text.

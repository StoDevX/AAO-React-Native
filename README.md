## About
The St. Olaf community, now in pocket sizeâ€¦ rewritten in React Native.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
- `cd` into the folder
- Install React Native: http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content
- `npm install`
- `npm run ios`

## Note
The Calendar might nag you for a Google Calendar API key. You can either ask someone involved with this project for a key, or you may [create one yourself](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials) for use during development.

1. Create a copy of the `.env.sample.js` file and rename it to `.env.js`
2. Insert your API key in place of the `key goes here` text

## Contributing
Would you like to contribute? Great! Have a look at [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and have at it. Pull requests required, so fork away and make one! If you feel like you should have write access to the repo, make an issue and we can discuss it.

We use two continuous-integration (CI) systems to make sure that the project still works as we change things. Any submissions you make will be validated by the CIs.

Before you commit and push, make sure to run `npm run lint` on your copy and fix any errors or warnings that it shows. We try to keep the `master` branch clean of all messages from eslint.

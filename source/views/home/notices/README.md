- [x] A title, optional (if ommitted, the snippet is shown on two lines.)
- [x] An icon; defaults to `(!)`
- [x] A background color???
- [x] A foreground color???
- [x] A snippet to show on the home screen (optional; defaults to truncated `message`)
- [x] A longer, markdown-formatted message to be shown on the detail view
- [ ] Severity levels, to do ??? something
	- I think my original idea was to pick default colors / icons for severity levels
- [ ] Conditions, similar to the versionRange property in the help widgets, but more comprehensive
	- [ ] platform
	- [ ] semver-compatible version ranges
	- [ ] dates, inclusive (from date through date)
	- [ ] boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- [ ] A Dissmissable property (defaults to true); prevents the user from dismissing the notice, if false
- [ ] The ability to automatically repeat a message at each `$interval` (TODO: choose how to define the interval; cron / ISO8601 / ics?) [okay cron is much simpler than ISO/ICS rrules.]

# Known Issues
- Building Hours: It reports the 2am buildings as open too often; for instance, the Pause is open on Saturday at 2am, continuing from Friday, but the app reports it as being open on Friday at 2am, as well. This is incorrect.
- Radio: The KSTO or KRLX radio player button can get stuck at "starting" and no music playing. The temporary solution is to hit play/pause _one_ more time.

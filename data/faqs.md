# Known Issues
- Webcam streams are down â€“ Broadcast Media just changed how their streams work. We think we've figured it out and are working on an update to resolve it now.
- Building Hours: It reports the 2am buildings as open too often; for instance, the Pause is open on Saturday at 2am, continuing from Friday, but the app reports it as being open on Friday at 2am, as well. This is incorrect.

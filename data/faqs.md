# Known Issues
- SIS: we're working on a way to have you log into the sis for more than 15 minutes at a time.
- Building Hours: It reports the 2am buildings as open too often; for instance, the Pause is open on Saturday at 2am, continuing from Friday, but the app reports it as being open on Friday at 2am, as well. This is incorrect.
- The Cage menu only shows specials: that's a limitation of the data we get from BonApp. SGA is talking with them about providing the rest of the Cage menu. One day, it'll suddenly work!

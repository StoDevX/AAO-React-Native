# All About Olaf Privacy Policy

We respect your right to privacy when using our app, All About Olaf.

Our policy towards privacy is simple: we aim to collect no data other than what
we need to keep the app functional and ensure a smooth experience for all users.

## Who runs this app?

This app is developed and maintained by a mixed team of current students at St.
Olaf College and alumni of St. Olaf College.  Anyone is welcome to make
contributions to the app, and the source code for the app is publicly available
[on GitHub][repo].  All contributions go through code review by maintainers.

This app is entirely self-funded, and we do not include advertisements on our
app.  As such, our privacy policy is quite simple.

[repo]: https://github.com/StoDevX/AAO-React-Native

## What data do you collect?

When you "Sign in with St. Olaf" in the settings, your St. Olaf username and
password are stored locally, on your device, in the encrypted keychain storage
mechanism available on your device.  _We do not transmit these credentials to or
through any servers that we control, and we do not have the ability to remotely
access these credentials_.  These credentials become inaccessible when you delete
the app.  We only transmit these credentials to on-campus servers, and the
security of those servers is not controlled by us.

When you fetch any data besides your personal information, your requests may
reach servers that we control.  Whenever your app makes such a request, the
following information is logged:

1. _Your public IP address_.  We do not use this to identify you or for tracking
  purposes, and this is logged only for diagnostic purposes.
2. _The version of All About Olaf you are using and information about your
  phone_, which is sent as part of your device's request.  This data is
  intentionally vague so that we can also not use this to identify you.
3. _What you requested and how long it took_, which is widely considered to be
  fully anonymous.

We also use _Sentry_, which collects crash reports and cannot be disabled
currently. Sentry collects in-depth information about the device and
circumstances leading up to a given crash.

If you send us suggestions for updates to building hours, we will anonymously add
them to the app if we determine that they are correct.  We do not currently give
credit for these contributions, primarily because we don't have an easy way of
attributing these.  In its current form, the "suggest an update" feature requires
you to send an email, and this email is sent to our developer mailing list.

If you choose to use the "Submit a Wi-Fi problem" feature or other features and
tools that use college systems such as StoPrint, your data is transmitted to
those systems exclusively, and we do not have the ability to see it.

Most importantly: **the developers and maintainers of All About Olaf _will not_,
under any circumstances, grant access to any personally identifiable information
that we may have collected to a third party, unless as required by law**.  We
treat your data as confidential and have the utmost respect for your privacy, and
we think that sharing data with other companies for marketing purposes or
compensation is a blatant violation of trust; we will never share this data.

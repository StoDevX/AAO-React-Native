# All About Olaf Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is intended to better inform our users about whether or not (and if so, how) we use their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) online.
PII, as described in United States privacy law and the field of information security, is defined as:

> Information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.

We invite you to read this Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of what information we collect and use, and to develop an understanding of how we handle your Personally Identifiable Information.
Feel free to reach out to the development team <allaboutolaf@stolaf.edu> if you have any questions.

## General Information

## Who runs this app? Who is processing data?

This app is developed by a team of students and alumni who operate independently of St. Olaf College ("The College"), and this app is not supported in any official capacity by The College.
However, in order to collect information which is then presented to the user, (such as Menu data, SIS Balances, etc.) we make external network connections to services that are operated by The College or its affiliates.
Any data that All About Olaf and its related systems collects is only accessible to trusted members of this team and will not be shared with any third parties.
Any data that the external systems that All About Olaf interacts with may collect is accessible only to those who operate those external systems.

It is worth noting that All About Olaf is an Open Source project, which means that you can read every line of source code that goes into this app and verify our claims.
We encourage contributions from St. Olaf students, as this helps us to build new features and improvements that all users can enjoy.

## What data _is_ being processed?

There are a few different types of data we process, and various reasons why.

- **User Credentials**, which include the User's username and password, are voluntarily entered by the user and stored locally in an encrypted datastore on the user's device until they uninstall the app.

- **Analytics Data**, which consists of metrics relating to feature usage and engagement, is only collected when the "Share Analytics" option is enabled in the Settings view.

- **Data Voluntarily Submitted by Users**, such as Building Hours update suggestions, are currently related to users who submit this data.
  The voluntary submission of building hours updates is processed through email, and there is no requirement that you use your `@stolaf.edu` email address to submit suggestions.
  We will not identify your contributions publicly without your explicit consent.

## What is the legal basis for processing this data?

We need to process this data in order to provide you, the User, an experience that is satisfactory.

## Will the data be shared with any third parties?

No.
We do not share any data with third parties, except in situations where we are legally required to, or in additional situations as noted elsewhere in this document.
Your data may also be shared with The College for investigative or diagnostic purposes, but in general we do not use this data because we don't really need to.
Your usage of the All About Olaf app may be monitored by the entity that controls your network.

## How will the information be used?

- **User Credentials** are expressly _never_ transmitted unless for the purpose of authenticating with an external system such as the SIS for the purpose of reading a user's balances.

- **Analytics Data** are used for development purposes to understand how our users interact with the app and what the most common features and usage cases are.
  We _do not_ share this Analytics Data with any third parties, except numbers of daily active users and amounts of feature usage.
  Again, we neither have the ability to nor are interested in correlating this information with your identity, and we will never do that without your express opt-in consent.
  We cannot and will not correlate Analytics Data with an identity or attempt to identify you by your app usage.

- **Data Voluntarily Submitted by Users** are used to improve the experience for all users by updating the data that the app uses.

## How long will the data be stored for?

**User Credentials** are stored locally on each device only for the duration of All About Olaf's installation.
These credentials are stored using your device's standard means of storage, and cannot be retrieved.

## What rights do data subjects have?

Data subjects can request a manual removal of any identifying data that we might have on record by sending an email to <allaboutolaf@stolaf.edu>.
We will check to see if we do have any identifying data, but because of the very limited amount of data that we do collect, we will not

## How can data subjects raise a complaint?

## Third-party disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.

## Third-party links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website.

Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

See more at [consumercal.org][caloppa].

[caloppa]: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:

Users can visit our site anonymously.
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.

You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.

## COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

## Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

We will notify you via email within 1 business day.

We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1 business day.

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

## CAN-SPAM Act

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:

- Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
- Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
- Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
- Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
- Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.
- Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at <allaboutolaf@stolaf.edu> and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.

## Google Analytics

The app also uses Google Analytics to see how people use the app, which allow us to prioritize our development time more efficiently.

  All About Olaf is a collaborative application created by students and alumni
  of St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN under the name StoDevX. It is inspired
  by the original 'All About Olaf', an iOS application created by Drew Volz as
  an independent project in 2014.


  This version was written in the summer of 2016, led by Elijah Verdoorn and
  assisted by Hawken Rives and Drew Volz. The app is supported as well as
  published by the Student Government Association (SGA) web team, called the
  Oleville Development Team.

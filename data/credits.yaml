  ### 🏡 October 2017 — Today

  Alumni of St. Olaf — Hawken Rives, Kris Rye, and Drew Volz — develop and
  support the app in its current form.  Rewritten from top to bottom in
  Typescript, this is the version you see today in the iOS and Android app
  stores. It remains self-published, open-source, cross-platform, and free
  of trackers and data collection.

  ### 🧱 July 2016 — September 2017

  This version was written in the summer of 2016, led by Elijah Verdoorn and
  assisted by Hawken Rives and Drew Volz. The app was supported and published
  by the Student Government Association (SGA) web team, called the
  Oleville Development Team.

  ### 🏗 2014

  The first version of All About Olaf was an iOS app created by Drew Volz as
  an independent project, self-published and written in Objective-C.

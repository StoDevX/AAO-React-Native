Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\n3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

Always returns `false` on Android.\n\nBecause these all return promises, you can use them with ES2016's async/await syntax, too!\n\nFor example, you can import all of the functions as a namespace:\n\n```js\nimport * as Icons from '@hawkrives/react-native-alternate-icons';\n\nawait Icons.setIconName(iconName);\n```\n\nor import just one or two of them:\n\n```js\nimport {getIconName} from '@hawkrives/react-native-alternate-icons';\n\nawait getIconName();\n```"

While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.\n\n```js\nfixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'\nfixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '\nfixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'\n```\n\n#### `ifElse`\n\n```ts\nifElse(\n  condition: Condition,\n  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,\n  elseFragment: string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n\ntype ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;\ntype Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);\n```\n\nChange the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.\n\n```js\nlet condition = getConditionValue()\nifElse(\n  () => condition,\n  color('red', 'ERROR'),\n  color('yellow', 'WARNING')\n)\n```\n\n#### `provide`\n\n```ts\nprovide<T>(\n  value: T,\n  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n```\n\nProvides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.\n\n```js\nprovide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {\n  switch (value.level) {\n    case 'error':\n      return container(\n        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    case 'info':\n      return container(\n        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    default:\n      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n<!-- badges (common) -->\n\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[prs-welcome-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[prs-welcome]: http://makeapullrequest.com\n[coc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of-conduct-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[coc]: https://github.com/zamotany/ansi-fragments/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=7289DA&logo=discord\n[chat]: https://discord.gg/zwR2Cdh\n\n[version]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-fragments"

Grant of Patent License.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright 2015 AJ ONeal\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log('data from socket', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect('/socket');\n\nsocket.on('data', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```"

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install chokidar\n```\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also\n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks\n  on a \"submit\" button from firing a second time.\n\n  The debounced function returned has a property 'clear' that is a \n  function that will clear any scheduled future executions of your function.\n\n  The debounced function returned has a property 'flush' that is a \n  function that will immediately execute the function if and only if execution is scheduled,\n  and reset the execution timer for subsequent invocations of the debounced\n  function.\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n\n  Original implementation is from [`underscore.js`](http://underscorejs.org/)\n  which also has an MIT license."

So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did\nand HTTP request and returned the response body.\n\nThe user has provided us with this implementation:\n\n``` js\nfunction myFn () {\n  var one = get('https://google.com');\n  var two = get('http://nodejs.org');\n  var three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));\n  return [one, two, three];\n}\n```\n\nNow we can compile this into an asyncronous generator function, implement the\nasync `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function\ninstance with the `vm` module:\n\n\n``` js\nvar co = require('co');\nvar vm = require('vm');\nvar degenerator = require('degenerator');\n\n// the `get()` function is thunk-based (error handling omitted for brevity)\nfunction get (endpoint) {\n  return function (fn) {\n    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');\n    var req = mod.get(endpoint);\n    req.on('response', function (res) {\n      var data = '';\n      res.setEncoding('utf8');\n      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });\n      res.on('end', function () {\n        fn(null, data);\n      });\n    });\n  };\n}\n\n// convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)\nstr = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);\n\n// at this stage, you could use a transpiler like `facebook/regenerator`\n// here if desired.\n\n// turn the JS String into a real GeneratorFunction instance\nvar genFn = vm.runInNewContext('(' + str + ')', { get: get });\n\n// use a generator-based flow control library (`visionmedia/co`, `jmar777/suspend`,\n// etc.) to create an async function from the generator function.\n\nvar asnycFn = co(genFn);\n\n// NOW USE IT!!!\nasyncFn(function (err, res) {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### degenerator(String jsStr, Array functionNames) → String\n\nReturns a \"degeneratorified\" JavaScript string, with ES6 Generator\nfunctions transplanted.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.\n\nIf you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`\n- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`\n- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`\n- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`\n\nNote: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install denodeify --save\n```\n\nOr:-\n\n```\nbower install denodeify --save\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nSimple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);\n\nreadFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    console.log(\"My file's contents is: \" + text);\n  });\n```\n\n(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)\n\nMore complex example with `exec`:-\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nYou can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n\n  // Throw away stderr data\n  return [err, stdout];\n});\n\nexec('hostname')\n  .then(function(host) {\n    console.log(\"My hostname is: \" + host.replace('\\n', ''));\n  });\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];\n});\n\nexec('my-command')\n  .then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"stdout is: \" + results[0]);\n    console.log(\"stderr is: \" + results[1]);\n  });\n```\n\nUseful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nThe lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request."

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

There is built-in support for a variety of \"protocols\", and it's\neasily extensible with more:\n\n| Protocol  | Description                     | Example\n|:---------:|:-------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:\n| `data`    | [Data URIs][data]               | `data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D`\n| `file`    | [File URIs][file]               | `file:///c:/windows/example.ini`\n| `ftp`     | [FTP URIs][ftp]                 | `ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/site/README`\n| `http`    | [HTTP URIs][http]               | `http://www.example.com/path/to/name`\n| `https`   | [HTTPS URIs][https]             | `https://www.example.com/path/to/name`\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install get-uri\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nTo simply get a `stream.Readable` instance from a `file:` URI, try something like:\n\n``` js\nvar getUri = require('get-uri');\n\n// `file:` maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance…\ngetUri('file:///Users/nrajlich/wat.json', function (err, rs) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  rs.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n\nMissing Endpoints\n-----------------\n\nWhen you pass in a URI in which the resource referenced does not exist on the\ndestination server, then a `NotFoundError` will be returned. The `code` of the\nerror instance is set to `\"ENOTFOUND\"`, so you can special-case that in your code\nto detect when a bad filename is requested:\n\n``` js\ngetUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {\n  if (err) {\n    if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {\n      // bad file path requested\n    } else {\n      // something else bad happened...\n      throw err;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // your app code…\n});\n```\n\n\nCacheability\n------------\n\nWhen calling `getUri()` with the same URI multiple times, the `get-uri` module\nsupports sending an indicator that the remote resource has not been modified\nsince the last time it has been retreived from that node process.\n\nTo do this, pass in a `cache` option to the \"options object\" argument\nwith the value set to the `stream.Readable` instance that was previously\nreturned. If the remote resource has not been changed since the last call for\nthat same URI, then a `NotModifiedError` instance will be returned with it's\n`code` property set to `\"ENOTMODIFIED\"`.\n\nWhen the `\"ENOTMODIFIED\"` error occurs, then you can safely re-use the\nresults from the previous `getUri()` call for that same URI:\n\n``` js\n// maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance\ngetUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  // … some time later, if you need to get this same URI again, pass in the\n  // previous `stream.Readable` instance as `cache` option to potentially\n  // receive an \"ENOTMODIFIED\" response:\n  var opts = { cache: rs };\n  getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', opts, function (err, rs2) {\n    if (err) {\n      if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {\n        // bad file path requested\n      } else if ('ENOTMODIFIED' == err.code) {\n        // source file has not been modified since last time it was requested,\n        // so `rs2` is undefined and you are expected to re-use results from\n        // a previous call to `getUri()`\n      } else {\n        // something else bad happened...\n        throw err;\n      }\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### getUri(String uri[, Object options,] Function callback)\n\nA `uri` String is required. An optional `options` object may be passed in:\n\n - `cache` - A `stream.Readable` instance from a previous call to `getUri()` with the same URI. If this option is passed in, and the destination endpoint has not been modified, then an `ENOTMODIFIED` error is returned\n\nAny other options passed in to the `options` object will be passed through\nto the low-level connection creation functions (`http.get()`, `ftp.connect()`,\netc).\n\nInvokes the given `callback` function with a `stream.Readable` instance to\nread the resource at the given `uri`.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[data]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397\n[file]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoffman-file-uri-03\n[ftp]: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc959/\n[http]: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html\n[https]: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure",

    "licenseText": "# Growly #\n\nSimple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.\n\n## Installation ##\n\nInstall growly using `npm`:\n\n```\nnpm install growly\n```\n\nAnd then require it:\n\n```javascript\nvar growly = require('growly');\n```\n\nThis module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.\n\n## Example ##\n\nSending a minimal Growl notification:\n\n```javascript\nvar growly = require('growly');\n\ngrowly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' });\n```\n\nMore examples can be found in the *example/* directory.\n\n## Usage ##\n\nThe growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.\n\n### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###\n\nRegisters a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.\n\n  - `appname` the name of the application (required.)\n  - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.\n  - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:\n    - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)\n    - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)\n    - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)\n  - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\ngrowly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [\n    { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },\n    { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }\n], function(err) {\n    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###\n\nSends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.\n\n  - `text` the body of the notification.\n  - `opts` an object with the following properties:\n    - `.title` title of the notification.\n    - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.\n    - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)\n    - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)\n    - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).\n    - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.\n  - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\n/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */\ngrowly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {\n    console.log('Action:', action);\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###\n\nSet the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

    "publisher": "Jens Taylor",
    "url": "https://github.com/homebrewing",
    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

[Plugins](#plugins)\n\n\n## Goal and Philosophy\n\n<img align=\"right\" alt=\"Inquirer Logo\" src=\"/assets/inquirer_readme.png\" title=\"Inquirer.js\"/>\n\n**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the \"CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)\").\n\n**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of\n- providing *error feedback*\n- *asking questions*\n- *parsing* input\n- *validating* answers\n- managing *hierarchical prompts*\n\n> **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).\n\n\n## [Documentation](#documentation)\n<a name=\"documentation\"></a>\n\n### Installation\n<a name=\"installation\"></a>\n\n``` shell\nnpm install inquirer\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar inquirer = require('inquirer');\ninquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */]).then(function (answers) {\n\t// Use user feedback for... whatever!!\n});\n```\n\n<a name=\"examples\"></a>\n### Examples (Run it and see it)\nCheck out the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.\n\n``` shell\nnode examples/pizza.js\nnode examples/checkbox.js\n# etc...\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n<a name=\"methods\"></a>\n#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -> promise`\n\nLaunch the prompt interface (inquiry session)\n\n- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)\n- returns a **Promise**\n\n#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`\n\nRegister prompt plugins under `name`.\n\n- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)\n- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)\n\n#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -> prompt function`\n\nCreate a self contained inquirer module. If you don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.\n\n```js\nvar prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();\n\nprompt(questions).then(/* ... */);\n```\n\n### Objects\n<a name=\"objects\"></a>\n\n#### Question\n<a name=\"questions\"></a>\nA question object is a `hash` containing question related values:\n\n- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,\n`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`\n- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.\n- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\n- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\n- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\nArray values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).\n- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and answers hash. Should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.\n- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.\n- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.\n- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`.\n- **prefix**: (String) Change the default _prefix_ message.\n- **suffix**: (String) Change the default _suffix_ message.\n\n`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  /* Preferred way: with promise */\n  filter: function () {\n    return new Promise(/* etc... */);\n  },\n\n  /* Legacy way: with this.async */\n  validate: function (input) {\n    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback\n    var done = this.async();\n\n    // Do async stuff\n    setTimeout(function () {\n      if (typeof input !== 'number') {\n        // Pass the return value in the done callback\n        done('You need to provide a number');\n        return;\n      }\n      // Pass the return value in the done callback\n      done(null, true);\n    }, 3000);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Answers\n<a name=\"answers\"></a>\nA key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.\n\n- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object\n- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)\n  - `confirm`: (Boolean)\n  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)\n  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)\n\n### Separator\n<a name=\"separator\"></a>\nA separator can be added to any `choices` array:\n\n```\n// In the question object\nchoices: [ \"Choice A\", new inquirer.Separator(), \"choice B\" ]\n\n// Which'll be displayed this way\n[?] What do you want to do?\n > Order a pizza\n   Make a reservation\n   --------\n   Ask opening hours\n   Talk to the receptionist\n```\n\nThe constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.\n\nSeparator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.\n\n<a name=\"prompt\"></a>\n### Prompt types\n---------------------\n\n> **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._\n\n#### List - `{type: 'list'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)\n\n![List prompt](assets/screenshots/list-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must the choice `index` in the array)\n\n![Raw list prompt](assets/screenshots/rawlist-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)\n\nNote that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.\n\nSee `examples/expand.js` for a running example.\n\n![Expand prompt closed](assets/screenshots/expand-prompt-1.png)\n![Expand prompt expanded](assets/screenshots/expand-prompt-2.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.\n\nChoices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.\n\nChoices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `\"Disabled\"`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.\n\n![Checkbox prompt](assets/screenshots/checkbox-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.\n\n![Confirm prompt](assets/screenshots/confirm-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Input - `{type: 'input'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.\n\n![Input prompt](assets/screenshots/input-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.\n\n![Password prompt](assets/screenshots/password-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties\n\nLaunches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.\n\n<a name=\"layouts\"></a>\n## User Interfaces and layouts\n\n\nAlong with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.\n\n#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`\n\nThis UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.\n\n```javascript\nvar ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();\n\n// pipe a Stream to the log zone\noutputStream.pipe(ui.log);\n\n// Or simply write output\nui.log.write('something just happened.');\nui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');\n\n// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader\n// or output a progress bar, etc\nui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');\n```\n\n<a name=\"reactive\"></a>\n## Reactive interface\n\n\nInternally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.\n\nThis mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:\n\n```js\nvar prompts = new Rx.Subject();\ninquirer.prompt(prompts);\n\n// At some point in the future, push new questions\nprompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });\nprompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });\n\n// When you're done\nprompts.onCompleted();\n```\n\nAnd using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:\n\n```js\ninquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(\n  onEachAnswer,\n  onError,\n  onComplete\n);\n```\n\n## Support (OS Terminals)\n<a name=\"support\"></a>\n\nYou should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't\nlook at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!\n\n- **Mac OS**:\n  - Terminal.app\n  - iTerm\n- **Windows**:\n  - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)\n  - cmd.exe\n  - Powershell\n  - Cygwin\n- **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:\n  - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)\n  - konsole\n\n\n## News on the march (Release notes)\n<a name=\"news\"></a>\n\n\nPlease refer to the [Github releases section for the changelog](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/releases)\n\n\n## Contributing\n<a name=\"contributing\"></a>\n\n**Unit test**\nUnit test are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Please add a unit test for every new feature or bug fix. `npm test` to run the test suite.\n\n**Documentation**\nAdd documentation for every API change. Feel free to send typo fixes and better docs!\n\nWe're looking to offer good support for multiple prompts and environments. If you want to\nhelp, we'd like to keep a list of testers for each terminal/OS so we can contact you and\nget feedback before release.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

    "licenseText": "# metro-react-native-babel-preset\n\nBabel presets for React Native applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.\n\nIf you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `.babelrc` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `.babelrc` file.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:\n```sh\nnpm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev\n```\n\n### Configuring Babel\n\nThen, create a file called `.babelrc` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `.babelrc` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"module:metro-react-native-babel-preset\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `.babelrc` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/) to learn more.\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue."

    "publisher": "Olivier Poitrey",
    "licenseText": "Netmask\n=======\n\nThe Netmask class parses and understands IPv4 CIDR blocks so they can be explored and compared. This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\n    var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask\n\n    var block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');\n    block.base;                     // 10.0.0.0\n    block.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0\n    block.bitmask;                  // 12\n    block.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255\n    block.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255\n    block.size;                     // 1048576\n    block.first;                    // 10.0.0.1\n    block.last;                     // 10.15.255.254\n\n    block.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true\n    block.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true\n    block.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false\n\n    block.forEach(function(ip, long, index));\n\n    block.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')\n\nConstructing\n------------\n\nNetmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:\n\n    '216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.\n    '216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'\n    '216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'\n    '216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00\n    '216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.\n    '216.240.32'                    // A /24 block.\n    '216.240'                       // A /16 block.\n    '140'                           // A /8 block.\n    '216.240.32/24'\n    '216.240/16'\n\nAPI\n---\n\n- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.\n- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).\n- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).\n- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).\n- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).\n- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)\n- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address\n- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.\n- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.\n- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block. Undef will be returned if out of legal address space.\n- `.toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    $ npm install netmask\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Olivier Poitrey <rs@dailymotion.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

An optional `options` object may be passed in which\nrespects the following options:\n\n * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.\n * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the\n JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to\n include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For\n async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function\n instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were\n synchronous.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[pac-file-docs]: https://web.archive.org/web/20070602031929/http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html\n[pac-wikipedia]: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config",

If no proxy is set, an empty string is\nreturned.\n\nIt is your responsibility to actually proxy the request using the given URL.\n\nInstallation:\n\n```sh\nnpm install proxy-from-env\n```\n\n## Example\nThis example shows how the data for a URL can be fetched via the\n[`http` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), in a proxy-aware way.\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\nvar parseUrl = require('url').parse;\nvar getProxyForUrl = require('proxy-from-env').getProxyForUrl;\n\nvar some_url = 'http://example.com/something';\n\n// // Example, if there is a proxy server at 10.0.0.1:1234, then setting the\n// // http_proxy environment variable causes the request to go through a proxy.\n// process.env.http_proxy = 'http://10.0.0.1:1234';\n// \n// // But if the host to be proxied is listed in NO_PROXY, then the request is\n// // not proxied (but a direct request is made).\n// process.env.no_proxy = 'example.com';\n\nvar proxy_url = getProxyForUrl(some_url);  // <-- Our magic.\nif (proxy_url) {\n  // Should be proxied through proxy_url.\n  var parsed_some_url = parseUrl(some_url);\n  var parsed_proxy_url = parseUrl(proxy_url);\n  // A HTTP proxy is quite simple. It is similar to a normal request, except the\n  // path is an absolute URL, and the proxied URL's host is put in the header\n  // instead of the server's actual host.\n  httpOptions = {\n    protocol: parsed_proxy_url.protocol,\n    hostname: parsed_proxy_url.hostname,\n    port: parsed_proxy_url.port,\n    path: parsed_some_url.href,\n    headers: {\n      Host: parsed_some_url.host,  // = host name + optional port.\n    },\n  };\n} else {\n  // Direct request.\n  httpOptions = some_url;\n}\nhttp.get(httpOptions, function(res) {\n  var responses = [];\n  res.on('data', function(chunk) { responses.push(chunk); });\n  res.on('end', function() { console.log(responses.join(''));  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## Environment variables\nThe environment variables can be specified in lowercase or uppercase, with the\nlowercase name having precedence over the uppercase variant. A variable that is\nnot set has the same meaning as a variable that is set but has no value.\n\n### NO\\_PROXY\n\n`NO_PROXY` is a list of host names (optionally with a port). If the input URL\nmatches any of the entries in `NO_PROXY`, then the input URL should be fetched\nby a direct request (i.e. without a proxy).\n\nMatching follows the following rules:\n\n- `NO_PROXY=*` disables all proxies.\n- Space and commas may be used to separate the entries in the `NO_PROXY` list.\n- If `NO_PROXY` does not contain any entries, then proxies are never disabled.\n- If a port is added after the host name, then the ports must match. If the URL\n  does not have an explicit port name, the protocol's default port is used.\n- Generally, the proxy is only disabled if the host name is an exact match for\n  an entry in the `NO_PROXY` list. The only exceptions are entries that start\n  with a dot or with a wildcard; then the proxy is disabled if the host name\n  ends with the entry.\n\nSee `test.js` for examples of what should match and what does not.\n\n### \\*\\_PROXY\n\nThe environment variable used for the proxy depends on the protocol of the URL.\nFor example, `https://example.com` uses the \"https\" protocol, and therefore the\nproxy to be used is `HTTPS_PROXY` (_NOT_ `HTTP_PROXY`, which is _only_ used for\nhttp:-URLs).\n\nThe library is not limited to http(s), other schemes such as\n`FTP_PROXY` (ftp:),\n`WSS_PROXY` (wss:),\n`WS_PROXY` (ws:)\nare also supported.\n\nIf present, `ALL_PROXY` is used as fallback if there is no other match.\n\n\n## External resources\nThe exact way of parsing the environment variables is not codified in any\nstandard. This library is designed to be compatible with formats as expected by\nexisting software.\nThe following resources were used to determine the desired behavior:\n\n- cURL:\n  https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#ENVIRONMENT  \n  https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4af40b3646d3b09f68e419f7ca866ff395d1f897/lib/url.c#L4446-L4514  \n  https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4af40b3646d3b09f68e419f7ca866ff395d1f897/lib/url.c#L4608-L4638  \n\n- wget: \n  https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Proxies  \n  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/tree/src/init.c?id=636a5f9a1c508aa39e35a3a8e9e54520a284d93d#n383  \n  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/tree/src/retr.c?id=93c1517c4071c4288ba5a4b038e7634e4c6b5482#n1278  \n\n- W3:\n  https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Proxies/ProxyClients.html  \n\n- Python's urllib:\n  https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/936135bb97fe04223aa30ca6e98eac8f3ed6b349/Lib/urllib/request.py#L755-L782  \n  https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/936135bb97fe04223aa30ca6e98eac8f3ed6b349/Lib/urllib/request.py#L2444-L2479"

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

Great for use in Tablets; you can put entire views that you would normally show in a modal (on a smaller device) into a popover, optionally give it an anchor point, and have it float on top of all of the other views.\n\nIt is written entirely in JavaScript, but uses [React Native's native driver](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated.html) for responsive animations, even when the JS thread is busy.\n\nThe `<Popover>` is able to handle dynamic content and adapt to screen size changes while showing, and will move out of the way for on-screen keyboards automatically.\n\n\n##### Table of Contents\n* [Features](#features)\n* [Demo](#demo)\n* [Origins](#origins)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Standalone Usage](#standalone)\n  * [Props](#props)\n  * [Example](#standalone-example)\n* [Usage with React Navigation](#rn)\n* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n* [Upgrading](#upgrading)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Credits](#credits)\n\n## <a name=\"features\"/>Popover Features\n* Moves to avoid keyboard\n* Ability to show from a view, from a rect, or float in center of screen\n* Adapts to changing content size\n* Automatically detects best placement on screen\n* Moves to stay visible on orientation change or when entering split-screen mode\n* (Optional) Integration with [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)\n\n## <a name=\"demo\"/>Demo App\n\nYou can play around with the various features using [the Expo test app](https://expo.io/@steffeydev/popover-view-test-app).\nSource Code: [react-native-popover-view-test-app](https://github.com/SteffeyDev/react-native-popover-view-test-app)\n\n### <a name=\"origins\"/>A Note on Origins\n\nThis is a fork of [react-native-popover](https://github.com/jeanregisser/react-native-popover), originally created by Jean Regisser but since abandoned.\n\nI have rebuilt most of the library from the ground up for improved handling of changing screen sizes on tablets (split-screen mode), a redesigned automatic placement algorithm, and ES6 compatibility.\n\nSimilar forks exist on Github (such as [react-native-modal-popover](https://github.com/doomsower/react-native-modal-popover)), but this is the first to be published on NPM as far as I know.\n\n## <a name=\"installation\"/>Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm i react-native-popover-view\n```\nor\n```shell\nyarn add react-native-popover-view\n```\n\n## <a name=\"standalone\"/>Standalone Usage\n\n```jsx\nimport Popover from 'react-native-popover-view'\n\n...\n  render (\n    <Popover\n      isVisible={this.state.isVisible}>\n      <CustomElement />\n    </Popover>\n  )\n```\n\n### <a name=\"props\"/>Props\n\nProp              | Type     | Optional | Default     | Description\n----------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | -----------\nisVisible         | bool     | No       | false       | Show/Hide the popover\nfromView          | ref      | Yes      | null        | The `ref` of the view that should anchor the popover.\nfromRect          | rect     | Yes      | null        | Alternative to `fromView`.  Rectangle at which to anchor the popover.\ndisplayArea       | rect     | Yes      | screen rect | Area where the popover is allowed to be displayed\nplacement         | string   | Yes      | 'auto'      | How to position the popover - top &#124; bottom &#124; left &#124; right &#124; auto. When 'auto' is specified, it will determine the ideal placement so that the popover is fully visible within `displayArea`.\nonClose           | function | Yes      |             | Callback to be fired when the user taps outside the popover\ndoneClosingCallback | function | Yes    |             | Callback to be fired when the popover is finished closing (after animation)\nshowInModal       | bool     | Yes      | true        | Whether the popover should be encapsulated in the [Modal view from RN](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal.html), which allows it to show above all other content, or just be present in the view hierarchy like a normal view.\narrowStyle        | object   | Yes      | {}          | The style of the arrow that points to the rect. Supported options are `width`, `height`, and `backgroundColor`. You can use `{backgroundColor: 'transparent'}` to hid the arrow completely.\npopoverStyle      | object   | Yes      | {}          | The style of the popover itself. You can override the `borderRadius`, `backgroundColor`, or any other [`style` prop for a `View`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view-style-props.html).\nshowBackground    | bool     | Yes      | true        | Whether the background behind the popover darkens when the popover is shown.\nanimationConfig   | object     | Yes      |           | An object containing any configuration options that can be passed to Animated.timing (e.g. `{ duration: 600, easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.quad) }`).  The configuration options you pass will override the defaults for all animations.\nverticalOffset    | number     | Yes      | 0         | The amount to vertically shift the popover on the screen.  In certain Android configurations, you may need to apply a `verticalOffset` of `-StatusBar.currentHeight` for the popover to originate from the correct place.\ndebug             | bool       | Yes      | false     | Set this to `true` to turn on debug logging to the console.  This is useful for figuring out why a Popover isn't showing.\n\nIf neither `fromRect` or `fromView` are provided, the popover will float in the center of the screen.\n\n`rect` is an object with the following properties: `{x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number}`. You can create the object yourself, or `import Popover, { Rect } from 'react-native-popover-view` and create a rect by calling `new Rect(x, y, width, height)`.\n\nLikewise, `size` is an object with the following properties: `{width: number, height: number}`. You can create the object yourself, or `import Popover, { Size } from 'react-native-popover-view` and create a rect by calling `new Size(width, height)`.\n\n### <a name=\"standalone-example\"/>Full Example\n```jsx\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Popover from 'react-native-popover-view';\nimport {\n  AppRegistry,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Text,\n  TouchableHighlight,\n  View,\n} from 'react-native';\n\nclass PopoverExample extends Component {\n  state = {\n    isVisible: false\n  }\n\n  showPopover() {\n    this.setState({isVisible: true});\n  }\n\n  closePopover() {\n    this.setState({isVisible: false});\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <TouchableHighlight ref={ref => this.touchable = ref} style={styles.button} onPress={() => this.showPopover()}>\n          <Text>Press me</Text>\n        </TouchableHighlight>\n\n        <Popover\n          isVisible={this.state.isVisible}\n          fromView={this.touchable}\n          onClose={() => this.closePopover()}>\n          <Text>I'm the content of this popover!</Text>\n        </Popover>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: 'rgb(43, 186, 180)',\n  },\n  button: {\n    borderRadius: 4,\n    padding: 10,\n    marginLeft: 10,\n    marginRight: 10,\n    backgroundColor: '#ccc',\n    borderColor: '#333',\n    borderWidth: 1,\n  }\n});\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('PopoverExample', () => PopoverExample);\n```\n\n---\n\n## <a name=\"rn\"/>Usage with React Navigation\n\nTo use this library with React Navigation for deep integration, see [react-navigation-popover](https://github.com/SteffeyDev/react-navigation-popover).\n\n## <a name=\"troubleshooting\" />Troubleshooting\n\nIn all cases, start by passing the `debug={true}` prop to the Popover, to see if the debug output can help you figure out the issue.\n\n#### Show `fromView` not working\n\nFirst, make sure that the `ref` is defined prior to showing the Popover.  If you set the Popover's `isVisible` prop to `true` while the variable passed into `fromView` is undefined, the Popover will show centered on the screen.\n\nIf you pass in a `fromView` prop, but the Popover still shows centered on the screen on an **Android device**, try adding these props to the component whose `ref` you passed in to `fromView`:\n* `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid={true}`\n* `collapsable={false}`\n\nSee https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/3282 and https://github.com/SteffeyDev/react-native-popover-view/issues/28 for more info.\n\n## <a name=\"upgrading\" />Upgrading\n\n#### `1.0` to `1.1`\n\nThis version moved the react-navigation portion of this project to it's own repository: [react-navigation-popover](https://github.com/SteffeyDev/react-navigation-popover).\nTo use with react-navigation, install that npm package change `import { createPopoverStackNavigator } from 'react-native-popover-view'` to `import createPopoverStackNavigator from 'react-navigation-popover'`.\n\n#### `0.7` to `1.0`\n\nThe only breaking change in version 1.0 was renaming `PopoverStackNavigator` to `createPopoverStackNavigator`, to match the `react-navigation` other navigation functions.\n\n#### `0.5` to `0.6`\n\nVersion 0.6 brought some large changes, increasing efficiency, stability, and flexibility.  For React Navigation users, there is a new prop, `showInPopover`, that you might want to pass to `createPopoverStackNavigator` if you want to customize when to show stack views in a Popover.  This replaces `PopoverNavigation.shouldShowInPopover`. See the new [setup](#setup) instructions below for details.\n\n## <a name=\"contributing\">Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome; if you find that you are having to bend over backwards to make this work for you, feel free to open an issue or PR!  Of course, try to keep the same coding style if possible and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n## <a name=\"credits\"/>Credits\n\nOriginal codebase created by Jean Regisser <jean.regisser@gmail.com> (https://github.com/jeanregisser) as [react-native-popover](https://github.com/jeanregisser/react-native-popover), which has been abandoned.\n\n---\n\n**MIT Licensed**"

The current supported version is indicated on the React Native badge at the top of this README.  If it's out of date, we encourage you to submit a pull request!\n\n## Usage\n### Linking the Library\nIn order to use Safari View, you must first link the library your project.  There's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).\n\n### Displaying the Safari View\nOnce you've linked the library, you'll want to make it available to your app by requiring it:\n\n```js\nvar SafariView = require('react-native-safari-view');\n```\n\nDisplaying the Safari View is as simple as calling:\n```js\nSafariView.show({\n  url: 'https://github.com/naoufal'\n});\n```\n\n### URL Change Notifications\nThere isn't an API for retrieving URL changes provided by SFSafariViewController or its delegate in iOS, so there's no way to know where the user is navigating to. However, it is possible to get a notification when the Safari View navigates to an URL scheme specified by your app (e.g. `your-app-name://`). This is especially useful for implementing callback oriented flows such as in OAuth2 / OpenID Connect. \n\nTo get URL notifications for your URL scheme you'll need to:\n 1. Register an [URL scheme](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW10) in your Xcode Project\n 2. Make sure you've set up [Linking](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking.html) in your react-native project.\n 3. Listen for URL changes in your react-native code (i.e. `Linking.addEventListener('url', eventHandler)`);\n \n\n## Example\nUsing Safari View in your app will usually look like this:\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport SafariView from \"react-native-safari-view\";\n\nclass YourComponent extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  _pressHandler() {\n    SafariView.isAvailable()\n      .then(SafariView.show({\n        url: \"https://github.com/naoufal\"\n      }))\n      .catch(error => {\n        // Fallback WebView code for iOS 8 and earlier\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        ...\n        <Button onPress={this._pressHandler}>\n          Show Safari View\n        </Button>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n### show(safariOptions)\nDisplays a Safari View with the provided url.\n\n__Arguments__\n- `safariOptions` - An `Object` containing a `url` key and optionally a `readerMode` key, a `tintColor`, and/or a `barTintColor`.\n\n__safariOptions__\n- `url` - A `String` containing the url you want to load in the Safari View\n- `readerMode` - A `Boolean` indicating to use Safari's Reader Mode if available\n- `tintColor` - A `String` containing a hex, rgba or rgba color to use for the browser controls\n- `barTintColor` - A `String` containing a hex, rgba or rgba color to use for the background of the browser controls (only available on iOS 10 and higher)\n- `fromBottom` - A 'Boolean' indicating to open the Safari View from the bottom\n\n__Examples__\n```js\nSafariView.show({\n  url: \"http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/26/introducing-react-native.html\",\n  readerMode: true // optional,\n  tintColor: \"#000\" // optional\n  barTintColor: \"#fff\" // optional\n});\n```\n\n### isAvailable()\nChecks if Safari View is available on the device.\n\n__Example__\n```js\nSafariView.isAvailable()\n  .then(available => {\n    console.log(\"SafariView is available.\");\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n```\n\n### dismiss()\nDismisses the currently active Safari View.\n\n__Example__\n```js\nSafariView.dismiss()\n```\n\n## Events\nThe following events are fired by the Safari View.\n\n### onShow\n__Example__\n```js\nlet showSubscription = SafariView.addEventListener(\n  \"onShow\",\n  () => {\n    StatusBar.setBarStyle(\"light-content\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### onDismiss\n__Example__\n```js\nlet dismissSubscription = SafariView.addEventListener(\n  \"onDismiss\",\n  () => {\n    StatusBar.setBarStyle(\"default\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2015, [Naoufal Kadhom](http://naoufal.com)\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

    "licenseText": "# RxJS Aggregates Module #\n\nThe Reactive Extensions for JavaScript has a number of aggregation operators including those you might already know from the Array#extras and the upcoming ES6 standard such as `reduce`, `find` and `findIndex`.  This module is used exclusively for aggregation operations used on finite observable sequences.  In addition to the aforementioned operators, there are many useful operators such as `count`, `sum`, `average` and determining whether two sequences are equal via the `sequenceEqual` method.  This requires `rx.lite.js` from the [`rx-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rx-lite) NPM module.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere are a number of ways to get started with RxJS.\n\n### Installing with [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)\n\n```bash`\n$ npm install rx-lite-aggregates\n$ npm install -g rx-lite-aggregates\n```\n\n### Using with Node.js and Ringo.js\n\n```js\nvar Rx = require('rx-lite-aggregates');\n```\n\n### In a Browser:\n\n```html\n<!-- Just the core RxJS -->\n<script src=\"path/to/rx.lite.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"path/to/rx.lite.aggregates.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## Included Observable Operators ##\n\n### `Observable Instance Methods`\n- [`aggregate`](../../doc/api/core/operators/reduce.md)\n- [`all`](../../doc/api/core/operators/every.md)\n- [`any`](../../doc/api/core/operators/some.md)\n- [`average`](../../doc/api/core/operators/average.md)\n- [`includes`](../../doc/api/core/operators/includes.md)\n- [`count`](../../doc/api/core/operators/count.md)\n- [`elementAt`](../../doc/api/core/operators/elementat.md)\n- [`elementAtOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/elementatordefault.md)\n- [`every`](../../doc/api/core/operators/every.md)\n- [`find`](../../doc/api/core/operators/find.md)\n- [`findIndex`](../../doc/api/core/operators/findindex.md)\n- [`first`](../../doc/api/core/operators/first.md)\n- [`firstOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/firstordefault.md)\n- [`indexOf`](../../doc/api/core/operators/indexof.md)\n- [`isEmpty`](../../doc/api/core/operators/isempty.md)\n- [`last`](../../doc/api/core/operators/last.md)\n- [`lastOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/lastordefault.md)\n- [`max`](../../doc/api/core/operators/max.md)\n- [`maxBy`](../../doc/api/core/operators/maxby.md)\n- [`min`](../../doc/api/core/operators/min.md)\n- [`minBy`](../../doc/api/core/operators/minby.md)\n- [`reduce`](../../doc/api/core/operators/reduce.md)\n- [`sequenceEqual`](../../doc/api/core/operators/sequenceequal.md)\n- [`single`](../../doc/api/core/operators/single.md)\n- [`singleOrDefault`](../../doc/api/core/operators/singleordefault.md)\n- [`some`](../../doc/api/core/operators/some.md)\n- [`sum`](../../doc/api/core/operators/sum.md)\n- [`toMap`](../../doc/api/core/operators/tomap.md)\n- [`toSet`](../../doc/api/core/operators/toset.md)\n\n## Contributing ##\n\nThere are lots of ways to contribute to the project, and we appreciate our [contributors](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/wiki/Contributors).  If you wish to contribute, check out our [style guide]((https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc/contributing)).\n\nYou can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features as they are implemented, submit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submit code fixes or code contributions of your own. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Rx Team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc.

    "licenseText": "# Safe JSON Stringify\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/debitoor/safe-json-stringify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/debitoor/safe-json-stringify)\n[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/safe-json-stringify.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-json-stringify)\n\nA wrapper for `JSON.stringify` that handles circular references and prevents defined getters from throwing errors.\n\nCircular references are handled by returning `[Circular]` when a circular reference is spotted.\n\nDefined getters that throw errors are handled by returning `[Throws]`.\n\nUsage\n-----\nInstall it using NPM\n\n```sh\nnpm install safe-json-stringify\n```\n\nAnd require it into your Node project.\n\n```js\nconst safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');\nconst data = {foo: 'bar'}\n\nconsole.log(safeJsonStringify(data));\n```\n\nAll the parameters of `JSON.stringify` are accepted, try e.g. the following for a nicely formatted output:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(safeJsonStringify(data, null, 2));\n```\n\nAn `ensureProperties` function is exposed too, which returns a safe object without the stringify step. Usage: `safeJsonStringify.ensureProperties(data);`.\n\n\nWhy?\n----\nThe `stringify` function on the JavaScript JSON object will take any data and return a string representation of said data. If this data contains an object literal it will attempt to return the values of any enumerable property set on this object. This can be dangerous because JavaScript supports a couple of ways to define property getters on objects.\n\nThe old, non-standard, and now deprecated `Object.prototype.__defineGetter__()` will define a named property which value is the return of a given function.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nobj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { return 'bar'; });\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // {\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n```\n\nThis is kinda bad because we could make that function throw an error.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nobj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); });\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown\n```\n\nThis property is created as an enumerable on the object, so the object from the previous example would make any function that iterates choke and throw an error. This is bad because one would never expect a simple property get to throw an error and bring down a system.\n\n`JSON.stringify` will blindly trust any object property, and will throw an error if it hits a defined property that throws an error. This could potentially take down your program.\n\nThe slightly better `Object.defineProperty()` does the same thing, but has the common courtesy to not define the getter as enumerable--that is per default. The following example would bring us in the same situation as with `__defineGetter__`.\n\n```js\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nObject.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {\n    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },\n        enumerable: true // enumerable is false by default\n});\n\nJSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown\n```\n\nSo, we can not trust any of them. One could argue that they should never be used, and we can, and should, apply that principle to our own software, but we cannot trust code from third-party modules. If data from third-party modules are to be stringified by JSON we should take these situations into considerations. This module attempt to do that by spotting defined getters and return \"[Throws]\" if said getter throws an error.\n\n```js\nvar safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');\n// Never ever do this in your code. Please.\nvar obj = {};\nObject.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {\n    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },\n        enumerable: true\n});\n\nsafeJsonStringify(obj); // '{\"foo\":\"[Throws]\"}'\n```\n\nAnd it attempts to handle circular references too. It returns \"[Circular]\" if it spots one.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2017 [Debitoor](https://debitoor.com/)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It does that by:\n\n* By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive\n* Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues\n* Maintains a consistent API across different platforms\n* Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:\n  * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)\n  * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)\n  * polling\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install sane\n```\n\n## How to choose a mode\n\nDon't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane\nmaintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.\n\n* If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode\n* If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode\n* If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`\n* If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling\n* Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you\n\n## API\n\n### sane(dir, options)\n\nWatches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.\n\n```js\nvar watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});\nwatcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });\nwatcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });\n// close\nwatcher.close();\n```\n\noptions:\n\n* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.\n* `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).\n* `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.\n* `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).\n* `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n* `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\nFor the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).\nIf you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).\nIf you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)).\nFor the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).\n\n### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)\n\nThe watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:\n\n* interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close\n\nStops watching.\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events\n\nEmits the following events:\n\nAll events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory\n* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory\n* `change` when a file changes\n* `add` when a file or directory has been added\n* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted\n\n## CLI\n\nThis module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.\n\n```\nUsage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]\n\nOPTIONS:\n    --glob=<filePattern>\n      A single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n\n    --ignored=<filePattern>\n      A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\n    --poll, -p\n      Use polling mode.\n\n    --watchman, -w\n      Use watchman (if available).\n\n    --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>\n      Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).\n\n    --dot, -d\n      Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n\n    --wait=<seconds>\n      Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled\n      after running <command>. Setting this option will\n      throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.\n    --quiet, -q\n      Disables sane's console output\n\n    --changes-only, -o\n      Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup\n```\n\nIt will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.\n\n### CLI example usage\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --wait=3`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' -p`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Credits\nThe CLI was originally based on the [watch CLI](https://github.com/mikeal/watch).

Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar streamBuffers = require(\"stream-buffers\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Writable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nWritable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\r\n\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\r\n// - or -\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\r\nstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\r\n \r\nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\r\n\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\r\n```\t\r\n\r\n### Readable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \r\n\r\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tfrequency: 10,\t\t// in milliseconds.\r\n\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\t// Yup.\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. \r\n\r\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \r\n\r\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>\r\n * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

Correctly handles\nmulti-byte characters and surrogate pairs.\n\nA browser implementation that doesn't use `Buffer.byteLength` is\nprovided to minimize build size.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar truncate = require(\"truncate-utf8-bytes\")\nvar str = \"a☃\" // a = 1 byte, ☃ = 3 bytes\nconsole.log(truncate(str, 2))\n// -> \"a\"\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `var truncate = require(\"truncate-utf8-bytes\")`\n\n*When using browserify or webpack*, this automatically resolves to an\nimplementation that does not use `Buffer.byteLength`.\n\n### `truncate(string, length)`\n\nReturns `string` truncated to at most `length` bytes in length."

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

    "licenseText": "# ws: a node.js websocket library\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws)\n\n`ws` is a simple to use WebSocket implementation, up-to-date against RFC-6455,\nand [probably the fastest WebSocket library for node.js][archive].\n\nPasses the quite extensive Autobahn test suite. See http://websockets.github.com/ws\nfor the full reports.\n\n## Protocol support\n\n* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera.\n  Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the\n  `disableHixie` option to true.)\n* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`)\n* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`)\n\n### Installing\n\n```\nnpm install --save ws\n```\n\n### Opt-in for performance\n\nThere are 2 optional modules that can be installed along side with the `ws`\nmodule. These modules are binary addons which improve certain operations, but as\nthey are binary addons they require compilation which can fail if no c++\ncompiler is installed on the host system.\n\n- `npm install --save bufferutil`: Improves internal buffer operations which\n  allows for faster processing of masked WebSocket frames and general buffer\n  operations.\n- `npm install --save utf-8-validate`: The specification requires validation of\n  invalid UTF-8 chars, some of these validations could not be done in JavaScript\n  hence the need for a binary addon. In most cases you will already be\n  validating the input that you receive for security purposes leading to double\n  validation. But if you want to be 100% spec-conforming and have fast\n  validation of UTF-8 then this module is a must.\n\n### Sending and receiving text data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n  // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received.\n  // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked.\n});\n```\n\n### Sending binary data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  var array = new Float32Array(5);\n\n  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {\n    array[i] = i / 2;\n  }\n\n  ws.send(array, { binary: true, mask: true });\n});\n```\n\nSetting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be\nmasked according to the WebSocket protocol. The same option applies for text\ndata.\n\n### Server example\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n  });\n\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n```\n\n### ExpressJS example\n\n```js\nvar server = require('http').createServer()\n  , url = require('url')\n  , WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: server })\n  , express = require('express')\n  , app = express()\n  , port = 4080;\n\napp.use(function (req, res) {\n  res.send({ msg: \"hello\" });\n});\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  var location = url.parse(ws.upgradeReq.url, true);\n  // you might use location.query.access_token to authenticate or share sessions\n  // or ws.upgradeReq.headers.cookie (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/16395220/151312)\n\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n  });\n\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n\nserver.on('request', app);\nserver.listen(port, function () { console.log('Listening on ' + server.address().port) });\n```\n\n### Server sending broadcast data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.broadcast = function broadcast(data) {\n  wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {\n    client.send(data);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### Error handling best practices\n\n```js\n// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted\nws.send('something');\n\n// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional\n// callback. The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has\n// actually been sent.\nws.send('something', function ack(error) {\n  // if error is not defined, the send has been completed,\n  // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.\n});\n\n// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note** that\n// since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not* be\n// captured when this technique is used.\ntry { ws.send('something'); }\ncatch (e) { /* handle error */ }\n```\n\n### echo.websocket.org demo\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {\n  protocolVersion: 8,\n  origin: 'http://websocket.org'\n});\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  console.log('connected');\n  ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n});\n\nws.on('close', function close() {\n  console.log('disconnected');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function message(data, flags) {\n  console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);\n\n  setTimeout(function timeout() {\n    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n  }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### Other examples\n\nFor a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the\nexamples folder.\n\nNote that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express\n2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.\n\nOtherwise, see the test cases.\n\n### Running the tests\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\n## API Docs\n\nSee [`/doc/ws.md`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md) for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.\n\n## Changelog\n\nWe're using the GitHub [`releases`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases) for changelog entries.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik &lt;einaros@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[archive]: http://web.archive.org/web/20130314230536/http://hobbycoding.posterous.com/the-fastest-websocket-module-for-nodejs",

  "xregexp@2.0.0": {
    "licenses": "MIT",
    "repository": "https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp",
    "publisher": "Steven Levithan",
    "licenseText": "[XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/)\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nXRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular expressions. You get new syntax and flags beyond what browsers support natively, along with a collection of utils to make your client-side grepping and parsing easier. XRegExp also frees you from worrying about pesky inconsistencies in cross-browser regex handling and the dubious `lastIndex` property.\r\n\r\nXRegExp supports all native ES5 regular expression syntax. It's about 3.5 KB when minified and gzipped. It works with Internet Explorer 5.5+, Firefox 1.5+, Chrome, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nXRegExp regular expressions compile to native RegExp objects, thus there is no performance difference when using XRegExp objects with native methods. There is a small performance cost when *compiling* XRegExps. If you want, however, you can use `XRegExp.cache` to avoid ever incurring the compilation cost for a given pattern more than once. Doing so can even lead to XRegExp being faster than native regexes in synthetic tests that repeatedly compile the same regex.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage examples\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\n// Using named capture and flag x (free-spacing and line comments)\r\nvar date = XRegExp('(?<year>  [0-9]{4}) -?  # year  \\n\\\r\n                    (?<month> [0-9]{2}) -?  # month \\n\\\r\n                    (?<day>   [0-9]{2})     # day   ', 'x');\r\n\r\n// XRegExp.exec gives you named backreferences on the match result\r\nvar match = XRegExp.exec('2012-02-22', date);\r\nmatch.day; // -> '22'\r\n\r\n// It also includes optional pos and sticky arguments\r\nvar pos = 3, result = [];\r\nwhile (match = XRegExp.exec('<1><2><3><4>5<6>', /<(\\d+)>/, pos, 'sticky')) {\r\n    result.push(match[1]);\r\n    pos = match.index + match[0].length;\r\n} // result -> ['2', '3', '4']\r\n\r\n// XRegExp.replace allows named backreferences in replacements\r\nXRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\nXRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, function (match) {\r\n    return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year;\r\n}); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\n\r\n// In fact, all XRegExps are RegExps and work perfectly with native methods\r\ndate.test('2012-02-22'); // -> true\r\n\r\n// The *only* caveat is that named captures must be referred to using numbered backreferences\r\n'2012-02-22'.replace(date, '$2/$3/$1'); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\n\r\n// If you want, you can extend native methods so you don't have to worry about this\r\n// Doing so also fixes numerous browser bugs in the native methods\r\nXRegExp.install('natives');\r\n'2012-02-22'.replace(date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\n'2012-02-22'.replace(date, function (match) {\r\n    return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year;\r\n}); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\ndate.exec('2012-02-22').day; // -> '22'\r\n\r\n// Extract every other digit from a string using XRegExp.forEach\r\nXRegExp.forEach('1a2345', /\\d/, function (match, i) {\r\n    if (i % 2) this.push(+match[0]);\r\n}, []); // -> [2, 4]\r\n\r\n// Get numbers within <b> tags using XRegExp.matchChain\r\nXRegExp.matchChain('1 <b>2</b> 3 <b>4 a 56</b>', [\r\n    XRegExp('(?is)<b>.*?</b>'),\r\n    /\\d+/\r\n]); // -> ['2', '4', '56']\r\n\r\n// You can also pass forward and return specific backreferences\r\nvar html = '<a href=\"http://xregexp.com/\">XRegExp</a>\\\r\n            <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\">Google</a>';\r\nXRegExp.matchChain(html, [\r\n    {regex: /<a href=\"([^\"]+)\">/i, backref: 1},\r\n    {regex: XRegExp('(?i)^https?://(?<domain>[^/?#]+)'), backref: 'domain'}\r\n]); // -> ['xregexp.com', 'www.google.com']\r\n\r\n// XRegExp.union safely merges strings and regexes into a single pattern\r\nXRegExp.union(['a+b*c', /(dogs)\\1/, /(cats)\\1/], 'i');\r\n// -> /a\\+b\\*c|(dogs)\\1|(cats)\\2/i\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThese examples should give you the flavor of what's possible, but XRegExp has more syntax, flags, utils, options, and browser fixes that aren't shown here. You can even augment XRegExp's regular expression syntax with addons (see below) or write your own. See [xregexp.com](http://xregexp.com/) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Addons\r\n\r\nIn browsers, you can either load addons individually, or bundle all addons together with XRegExp by loading `xregexp-all.js`. XRegExp's [npm](http://npmjs.org/) package uses `xregexp-all.js`, which means that the addons are always available when XRegExp is installed on the server using npm.\r\n\r\n\r\n### XRegExp Unicode Base\r\n\r\nIn browsers, first include the Unicode Base script:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"addons/unicode/unicode-base.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThen you can do this:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nvar unicodeWord = XRegExp('^\\\\p{L}+$');\r\nunicodeWord.test('Русский'); // -> true\r\nunicodeWord.test('日本語'); // -> true\r\nunicodeWord.test('العربية'); // -> true\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe base script adds `\\p{Letter}` and its alias `\\p{L}`, but other Unicode categories, scripts, blocks, and properties require addon packages. Try these next examples after additionally including `unicode-scripts.js`:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nXRegExp('^\\\\p{Hiragana}+$').test('ひらがな'); // -> true\r\nXRegExp('^[\\\\p{Latin}\\\\p{Common}]+$').test('Über Café.'); // -> true\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nXRegExp uses the Unicode 6.1 Basic Multilingual Plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n### XRegExp.build\r\n\r\nIn browsers, first include the script:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"addons/build.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nYou can then build regular expressions using named subpatterns, for readability and pattern reuse:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nvar time = XRegExp.build('(?x)^ {{hours}} ({{minutes}}) $', {\r\n    hours: XRegExp.build('{{h12}} : | {{h24}}', {\r\n        h12: /1[0-2]|0?[1-9]/,\r\n        h24: /2[0-3]|[01][0-9]/\r\n    }, 'x'),\r\n    minutes: /^[0-5][0-9]$/\r\n});\r\n\r\ntime.test('10:59'); // -> true\r\nXRegExp.exec('10:59', time).minutes; // -> '59'\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNamed subpatterns can be provided as strings or regex objects. A leading `^` and trailing unescaped `$` are stripped from subpatterns if both are present, which allows embedding independently useful anchored patterns. `{{…}}` tokens can be quantified as a single unit. Backreferences in the outer pattern and provided subpatterns are automatically renumbered to work correctly within the larger combined pattern. The syntax `({{name}})` works as shorthand for named capture via `(?<name>{{name}})`. Named subpatterns cannot be embedded within character classes.\r\n\r\nSee also: *[Creating Grammatical Regexes Using XRegExp.build](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/grammatical-patterns-xregexp-build)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n### XRegExp.matchRecursive\r\n\r\nIn browsers, first include the script:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"addons/matchrecursive.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nYou can then match recursive constructs using XRegExp pattern strings as left and right delimiters:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nvar str = '(t((e))s)t()(ing)';\r\nXRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '\\\\(', '\\\\)', 'g');\r\n// -> ['t((e))s', '', 'ing']\r\n\r\n// Extended information mode with valueNames\r\nstr = 'Here is <div> <div>an</div></div> example';\r\nXRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<div\\\\s*>', '</div>', 'gi', {\r\n    valueNames: ['between', 'left', 'match', 'right']\r\n});\r\n/* -> [\r\n{name: 'between', value: 'Here is ',       start: 0,  end: 8},\r\n{name: 'left',    value: '<div>',          start: 8,  end: 13},\r\n{name: 'match',   value: ' <div>an</div>', start: 13, end: 27},\r\n{name: 'right',   value: '</div>',         start: 27, end: 33},\r\n{name: 'between', value: ' example',       start: 33, end: 41}\r\n] */\r\n\r\n// Omitting unneeded parts with null valueNames, and using escapeChar\r\nstr = '...{1}\\\\{{function(x,y){return y+x;}}';\r\nXRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '{', '}', 'g', {\r\n    valueNames: ['literal', null, 'value', null],\r\n    escapeChar: '\\\\'\r\n});\r\n/* -> [\r\n{name: 'literal', value: '...', start: 0, end: 3},\r\n{name: 'value',   value: '1',   start: 4, end: 5},\r\n{name: 'literal', value: '\\\\{', start: 6, end: 8},\r\n{name: 'value',   value: 'function(x,y){return y+x;}', start: 9, end: 35}\r\n] */\r\n\r\n// Sticky mode via flag y\r\nstr = '<1><<<2>>><3>4<5>';\r\nXRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<', '>', 'gy');\r\n// -> ['1', '<<2>>', '3']\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n`XRegExp.matchRecursive` throws an error if it sees an unbalanced delimiter in the target string.\r\n\r\n\r\n### XRegExp Prototype Methods\r\n\r\nIn browsers, first include the script:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"addons/prototypes.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNew XRegExp regexes then gain a collection of useful methods: `apply`, `call`, `forEach`, `globalize`, `xexec`, and `xtest`.\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\n// To demonstrate the call method, let's first create the function we'll be using...\r\nfunction filter(array, fn) {\r\n    var res = [];\r\n    array.forEach(function (el) {if (fn.call(null, el)) res.push(el);});\r\n    return res;\r\n}\r\n// Now we can filter arrays using functions and regexes\r\nfilter(['a', 'ba', 'ab', 'b'], XRegExp('^a')); // -> ['a', 'ab']\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNative `RegExp` objects copied by `XRegExp` are augmented with any `XRegExp.prototype` methods. The following lines therefore work equivalently:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nXRegExp('[a-z]', 'ig').xexec('abc');\r\nXRegExp(/[a-z]/ig).xexec('abc');\r\nXRegExp.globalize(/[a-z]/i).xexec('abc');\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation and usage\r\n\r\nIn browsers:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp-min.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nOr, to bundle XRegExp with all of its addons:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp-all-min.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nUsing [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\r\n\r\n~~~ bash\r\nnpm install xregexp\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIn [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CommonJS module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules) loaders:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nvar XRegExp = require('xregexp').XRegExp;\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running tests on the server with npm\r\n\r\n~~~ bash\r\nnpm install -g qunit  # needed to run the tests\r\nnpm test  # in the xregexp root\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf XRegExp was not installed using npm, just open `tests/index.html` in your browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n## &c\r\n\r\n**Lookbehind:** A [collection of short functions](https://gist.github.com/2387872) is available that makes it easy to simulate infinite-length leading lookbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* Releases: [Version history](http://xregexp.com/history/).\r\n* Upcoming: [Milestones](https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp/issues/milestones), [Roadmap](https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp/wiki/Roadmap).\r\n\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nXRegExp and addons copyright 2007-2012 by [Steven Levithan](http://stevenlevithan.com/).\r\n\r\nTools: Unicode range generators by [Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/).

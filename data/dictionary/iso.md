definition: |
  The International Student Organization serves to facilitate discussions and exchanges on a series of cultural, political and personal topics by a series of events such as dinners, dances, International Awareness Week and the annual International Night. ISO also serves to strengthen the bonds between students from different backgrounds, while helping international students integrate into the greater student body. All are welcome to help coordinate or participate in ISO events, and membership is open to all St. Olaf students.

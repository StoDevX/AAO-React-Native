word: Work-study
definition: |
  It is very common for students to have an on-campus (or off-campus — CBWS) “student work” job. These jobs are also known as work-study positions. Students are awarded a certain amount of “work-study” allowance from the financial aid office. Work-study jobs can be found all over campus, from the caf to the library to most offices.

word: Kitchen (Pause)
definition: |
  The student-run, full kitchen offers tasty eats at ridiculously low prices. Famous pizzas, quesadillas, shakes, and ice cream all made-to-order! The kitchen is open late to serve that “late-night” craving! Hours are Sunday - Thursday: 10:30am - Midnight, and Friday - Saturday: 10:30am - 2am (shortened menu after 9pm on Fridays and Saturdays).

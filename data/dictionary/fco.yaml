  Fellowship of Christian Oles (FCO) is a group of people who gather once a week to discuss ideas, worship together, and share in the joy of Christ- centered relationships. We are a community striving to live as Christ calls us to live, with a heart for outreach in our own St. Olaf community and beyond. Through small groups, weekly meetings, and service trips we build relationships, welcoming people in all walks of Christian faith.

word: Old Main
definition: |
  Built in 1877, Old Main was the first — and originally the only — building to occupy Manitou Heights, containing classrooms, a library, housing for students and faculty, and a dining room. Newly renovated, Old Main is a beautiful place for students to study or relax. During the winter the Hill is a popular place for sledding!

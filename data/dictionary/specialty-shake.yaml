word: Specialty Shake
definition: |
  Throughout the year the Pause Kitchen comes up with new “specialty shakes” that usually pertain to the month or season. For example, in the fall the pumpkin pie shake is a big hit, and in the spring, the shamrock shake is a big seller. In addition to the specialty shakes, the Pause has quite a few regular flavors and toppings to choose from. All are delicious!

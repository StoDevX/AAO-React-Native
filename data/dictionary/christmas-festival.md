definition: |
  As one of the oldest musical celebrations of Christmas in the United States, Christmas Fest was started in 1912 by F. Melius Christiansen, founder of the St. Olaf College Music Department. The festival features more than 500 student musicians who are members of five choirs (St. Olaf Choir, Viking Chorus, Chapel Choir, Cantorei, and Manitou Singers) and the St. Olaf Orchestra. The festival, which is regularly broadcast nationwide on public television and radio, has been featured in hundreds of publications, including TV Guide, Wall Street Journal, and the Los Angeles Times.

word: PaCon
definition: |
  The Public Affairs Conversation (PaCon) engages students and faculty in a search to develop an interdisciplinary perspective on American public policy. This yearlong program for juniors and seniors consists of two courses (fall and spring) and an internship (in interim, spring, or summer). The courses focus on contested ideals and contemporary controversies in American public affairs. The first course looks at the evolution of contested ideals in American politics as they develop in the founding period and throughout the history of the republic. The course also engages a range of contemporary normative perspectives that are the foundation of the contemporary debate. The second course blends normative and empirical analysis of contemporary public policy. Both courses will be supplemented by co-curricular activities and events.

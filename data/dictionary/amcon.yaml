word: AmCon
definition: |
  Short for American Conversations, an interdisciplinary General Education program and learning community in which students analyze America’s history and culture.

  Over four successive semesters in their first and sophomore years, AmCon students encounter many of the texts, topics, and historical developments that have defined “America” from its earliest colonization to the present.

  AmCon students make up a true academic community, living in a common dorm in their first year and complementing their in-class education with dinners, informal gatherings and field trips. Through the inclusion of an academic civic engagement component, moreover, students develop as active citizens, bringing their ideas and energy into the larger community.

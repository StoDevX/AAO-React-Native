definition: |
  The Center for Advising and Academic Support (CAAS) provides resources for all St. Olaf students as they work to maximize their full academic potential. CAAS collaborates with faculty, staff, and other campus partners to provide a range of services, programs, and resources to support student learning. Support is student-centered, accessible, inclusive and free of charge.

  Advising supports both college advisors and their advisees in providing the necessary information and skills to fulfill graduation, general education, and major requirements. We also assist students in exploring possible major options, in changing faculty advisors, in using a degree audit, class/lab schedule, and the St. Olaf Catalog for necessary information about fulfilling requirements.

  Academic Support includes a variety of offerings to all St. Olaf students as they work to maximize their full potential. We teach tools, strategies, and provide opportunities to develop studentsâ€™ learning skills.

  Oles can take advantage of peer tutoring, group study, workshops, and one-on-one coaching. We look forward to meeting with you to discuss your individual learning goals

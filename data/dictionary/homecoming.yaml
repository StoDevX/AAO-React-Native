word: Homecoming
definition: |
  Every fall the Student Activities Committee (SAC) plans and hosts events, games, and activities for students during the week of Homecoming! The Alumni Office plans the festive weekend as the St. Olaf Community gathers for a fun-filled weekend of reconnection, celebration, and activity. Parents of current students and alumni from all classes, come back to the Hill and take part in the many hallmarks of campus life: learning with faculty members, athletic events and music concerts, worship, a campus festival for all ages, and more.

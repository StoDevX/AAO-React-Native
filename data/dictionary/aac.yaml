  The Academic Advising Center provides support in exploring academic goals within the context of possible career and life-long goals. The Center supports both faculty advisors and their advisees in providing the necessary information and skills to fulfill graduation, general education and major requirements.

  The Center also assists students in exploring possible major options, in changing faculty advisors, in using a degree audit, class/lab schedule, and the St. Olaf Catalog for necessary information about fulfilling requirements.

  Academic Peer Advisors assist the Center.

word: Quidditch
definition: |
  Since St. Olaf so closely resembles Hogwarts, it is only fair that we have a Quidditch club! The St. Olaf Quidditch Association brings the wonders of Quidditch to the St. Olaf campus on a weekly basis. With pick up games every week and the coveted House Cup, Quidditch provides the opportunity that everyone has always wanted.

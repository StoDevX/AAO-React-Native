word: Swiped Events
definition: |
  Every ESAC class (Wellness Center/physical education class) requires that students go to informational sessions run by the Wellness Center on a variety of topics. The Wellness Center representatives will “swipe” the Ole Cards of the students to prove they attended the session, or collect your name on a sheet of paper at the end of the event.

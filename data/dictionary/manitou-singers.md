word: Manitou Singers
definition: |
  Comprised of select women’s voices from the first year class, Manitou (pronounced Man·it·toe) is one of the most popular music organizations on the St. Olaf College campus. The 100-voice choir sings at the opening worship service of the college as well as at various campus functions throughout the year such as daily chapel and church services, the annual St. Olaf Christmas Festival, Family Weekend Concert and its own Spring concert in April. With a repertoire that ranges from sacred to secular to popular ballads, the Manitou Singers have broad appeal both on and off campus.

word: Ole card
definition: |
  The all-in-one I.D. card for all students. The Ole Card is used to eat meals in the Caf, buy coffee and snacks at the Cage, get a sweet treat at the Pause, purchase school supplies at the Bookstore, print documents for class, AND get students into their halls. The Ole Card carries “Flex dollars” in addition to “Ole dollars.” Flex dollars, provided by your meal plan, allow you to purchase things at the Cage; you can also use them to buy meals at the Caf, beyond what is provided with your meal plan. Ole dollars are the amount of money a student puts on their own Ole Card. They can be used at the Caf, the Cage, or the Pause, and some stores in town will also accept them. Students do not have to deposit money on their cards, but it makes for easy transactions around campus. Carleton's Caf network will also debit meals from your St. Olaf meal plan, so you can visit their campus, eat, and enjoy a change of scenery occasionally.

word: Senate
definition: |
  The Student Senate provides a venue where elected representatives — Hall Senators, special constituency Senators (like Multicultural and Off-Campus), faculty committee student participants, and the members of the SGA Executive team — discuss the operations of the Student Government. Administrators and staff present information regarding the College and frequently solicit student feedback from Senators. All Senate meetings are open to any student who wants to come and listen!

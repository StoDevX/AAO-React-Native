word: BASICS
definition: |
  BASICS is a “drinker’s checkup” that helps you examine your use, identify changes that could work for you and reduce your risk of future problems. It’s not therapy or substance abuse treatment. Any student who’s concerned about their alcohol or other drug use can choose to attend BASICS.

  Students who violate St. Olaf’s alcohol and drug policies, are medically transported for alcohol or drug intoxication, held in protective custody, or are court-sanctioned may be mandated to attend BASICS.

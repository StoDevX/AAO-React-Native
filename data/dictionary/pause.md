definition: |
  The Lion’s Pause, a branch of the Student Government Association (SGA),is most commonly shortened to just the Pause. This is a student-run nightclub located on the first floor of Buntrock Commons. Students are lucky to have a facility like this at their disposal — very few other schools in the nation have such a nice space! The Pause consists of 5 rooms: The Den, Lair, Jungle, Kitchen, and Mane Stage. The Kitchen is a student-staffed kitchen serving pizza, shakes, and more.

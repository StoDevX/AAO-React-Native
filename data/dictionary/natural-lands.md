word: Natural Lands
definition: |
  In addition to a 300-acre campus, the college owns nearly 700 acres of land adjacent to the campus. Most of this land was farmland rented out to local farmers. The college, principally through the members of the Biology and the Environmental Studies Departments, has conducted extensive natural habitat restoration projects over the past 15 years on some of this farmland. Over 40,000 tree seedlings and nursery stock trees have been planted on approximately 90 acres in an effort to re-establish the dominant Big Woods forest type originally found in our area. Over 150 acres of native, tall grass prairie has been reconstructed and 15 wetlands have been restored. A bluebird trail of 64 houses has been established through our woodlands and prairies. In addition to natural habitat restoration, a sustainable agriculture project has also been ongoing for over 10 years.

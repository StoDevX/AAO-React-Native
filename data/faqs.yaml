  # Known Issues
  - Login Unavailable: SIS now requires Google sign-in, which the All About Olaf app can't currently support. This means login and balances are unavailable until further notice.
  - Building Hours: It reports the 2am buildings as open too often; for instance, the Pause is open on Saturday at 2am, continuing from Friday, but the app reports it as being open on Friday at 2am, as well. This is incorrect.

    question: "Why can't I log in and see my balances?"
    answer: |-
      Unavailable until further notice.

      Balances login now appears to require Google sign-in on St. Olaf's end, which the All About Olaf app can't currently access or support.

      We'll update this if this change.

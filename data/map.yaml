  Known as “The Hill”, St. Olaf College’s picturesque 300-acre (120 ha) campus
  is home to 17 academic and administrative buildings, 29 student residences
  and 10 athletic facilities. St. Olaf is a residential college; 96 percent of
  St. Olaf students reside in one of the 11 residence halls and 18 academic
  and special interest group houses. Adjacent to campus are 325 acres (132 ha)
  of restored wetlands, woodlands, and native tall grass prairie owned and
  maintained by St. Olaf, and a utility-grade wind turbine that supplies up to
  one-third of the college’s daily electrical needs.

  Any member of the college community who feels they have experienced sexual
  misconduct  has the option of reporting to the college. Reporting enables
  the college to take measures to stop the behavior, prevent it from occurring
  in the future, and provide support, resources, and protection. You can report
  to the college without initiating a formal investigation or reporting to law
  enforcement.

  To make a report, contact the Title IX Case Manager or use St.
  Olafâ€™s online reporting form, which can be filled out anonymously: https://wp.stolaf.edu/title-ix/report-sexual-violence/.
